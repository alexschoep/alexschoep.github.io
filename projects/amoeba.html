<h1>
Amoeba (v1.0)
</h1>

<section>
Amoeba is a game that I programmed using Java. In the game, you
 control an 'amoeba' by specifying the direction that it
 grows in to consume other organisms and make yourself larger
 and more powerful. The source for this program is in a
 public github repository at the following link.

The .jar file to run this game can also be downloaded

The game world consists of a hexagonal matrix with different
 colors and symbols representing different types of 'cells'.
 The buttons at the bottom of the screen are used to adjust
 the view and your 'energy' displayed in the top right.
<br><br>
You begin the game with one cell and 0 energy. You gain
 energy over time based on the number of cells you have. I
 thought of this like the amoeba is conducting photosynthesis.
 The more surface area it has, the more energy it can absorb.

You can click on highlighted cells to expand your amoeba
 at the cost of energy. The cost of expanding to that cell
 is displayed in the middle of the cell. Notice that only
 some cells are highlighted. The 'body' of the amoeba cannot
 expand too far in one direction.

When your amoeba is large enough, it will grow a 'head'. They
 are differentiated from normal cells by the yellow circle in
 the center. Heads can expand infinitely far in any direction
 but at much higher energy cost. Heads should be mainly be used
 for exploration.

Other organisms can be consumed to absorb their energy. Finding
 other organisms can be challenging however, as only cells
 close to the amoeba are visible. Cells too far away to be
 visible are colored gray.
<br><br>

Expansion becomes increasingly difficult as the game
 progresses. The cost to expand to cells further from the
 origin of your amoeba grows exponentially, while energy
 gain from photosynthesis only grows linearly. This must
 be offset by consuming other organisms.

To implement the hexagonal matrix, I used a coordinate system
 similar to the one described 
<a href="http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/#coordinates"

here
</a>
. I kept track of which cells were adjacent to one another
 using a HashMap. It mapped a cell on to an ArrayList of cells
 which were adjacent to it. This was generated once at the
 beginning of the game and stored in memory to increase speed.
<br><br>
The graphical system was implemented using Java Swing. Each Cell
 object stores a Polygon object which I made a hexagon. The hexagon
 is scaled based on how far the game board is zoomed in, then translated
 to the correct position in the frame.
<br><br>
As of now the game is simple but I plan to add more content soon.
