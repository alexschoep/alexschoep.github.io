<h1>
Aerial Lighting and Imaging System
</h1>

<section>
I was part of a team that designed and built an embedded
 system to improve lighting conditions during drone
 photography. Our goal was to create a studio lighting system
 that could be mounted to a commercial quadcopter. The full
 documentation can be downloaded by clicking the following

We also made a video to describe the design of our system and
 demonstrate our prototype.

We tested our prototype on a DJI Phantom quadcopter.

We constructed the the circuit on a breadboard and mounted
 it to the rear side of the drone. The LED arrays were
 put at the front. All of the parts were mounted
 to the legs of the drone.

Our system involves two separate units. We referred to them
 as the LED Unit and the Remote Unit. The LED Unit is mounted
 to the drone. The Remote Unit is kept with the user so that
 they can control the operation of the system. The two units
 transmit and receive data over radio. Below is a diagram of
 our system.

The device has automatic and manual adjustment modes. In
 manual mode, the brightness of the LED's are controlled
 directly by the user with a potentiometer on the Remote
 Unit. In automatic mode, the brightness is adjusted based on
 data from a photoresistor on the LED Unit. All information
 about the system is displayed on an LCD connected to the
 Remote Unit.
