<h1>
Renewable Energy
</h1>

<section>
It is important that the world finds a sustainable source of energy that does not
 cause unmanagable harm to the enviornment. Ideally, we would use an energy source
 that is cheap, completely renewable, carbon-neutral, and does not procude any toxic
 byproducts. Improvments in technology and scaling of the renewable energy economy
 could make this a reality within the near future. At this moment however, solar and
 wind lack in affordability and availability.

The LCOE (levelised cost of electrcity) is a measure of the monetary cost of electrical
 energy per watt hour. It is a powerful statistic as it accounts for all of the factors
 that could affect the cost of energy. This includes transmission cost, operation cost,
 transportation of materials, the operating lifetime of a plant, and many other factors.
 The following image shows the predicted LCOE for each souce of energy in the US in 2020.

One of the main challenges with providing renewable energy is the availability of these sources.
 Geothermal is predicted to be the absolute cheapest source of energy in 2020 but it
 can only be used in areas with rare natural steam vents. In 2015, less than half of one
 percent of energy in the US came from geothermal sources
(Source:

 The next cheapest renewable source,
 wind, can obviously only be generated when the wind is blowing. Intermittent generation
 of power means it will be unreliable. A power network with many wind sources could
 struggle to meet demand on some days and have overproduction on other days. Even solar has
 problems with availability. Solar power networks have a surplus of energy during the day and
 have to rely on other sources at night. Thermal and photovoltaic solar are predicted to still
 be some of the most expensive energy sources in 2020.
