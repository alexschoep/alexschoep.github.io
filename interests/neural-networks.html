<h1>
Neural Networks
</h1>

<section>
I first learned about neural networks from a video on
 "Computerphile", a youtube podcast created by science
 videographer Brady Haran. I was very interested in the
 nonconventional way that machine learning is able to
 solve a computational problem. Of the many different
 types of machine learning, neural networks are among
 the most powerful. They are widely used in image
 processing and interpreting.

Here is another video that explains more about how a
 neural network functions. Dr. Mike Pound shows how
 they can be used to recognize a handwritten number
 or letter in an image.
