Neural Networks
</h1>

<section>
I first learned about neural networks from a video on
 "Computerphile", a youtube podcast created by science
 videographer Brady Haran. I was very interested in the
 nonconventional way that machine learning is able to
 solve a computational problem. Of the many different
 types of machine learning, neural networks are among
 the most powerful. They are widely used in image
 processing and interpreting.

Below is the Computerphile video that I mentioned.

Here is another video that explains more about how a
 neural network functions. Dr. Mike Pound shows how
 they can be used to recognize a handwritten number
 or letter in an image.

Google's Deep Dream software uses convolutional neural networks to process images
 and create interesting effects. "Deep" refers to deep learning which is one of the fields
 that CNN's come from. "Dream" comes from the strange images that it produces. Instead of
 using the network to classify some object in an image, Deep Dream edits the image to maximize
 the number of that object in the image. The following links contain some more information.

For example, if Deep Dream is told to look for eyes, anything in an image
 that has similar characteristics to an eye will have those characteristics maximized.
 The following image demonstrates this well.
